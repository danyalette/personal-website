Make your delaunay triangulation squirm in the updated version of this project, [here](https://danyalette.com/delaunay/squirm).

This version also allows you to toggle between wallpaper and wireframe mode.

I decided to build in this functionality because I wanted to make my polygonal background wallpaper be constantly moving slightly, _but_ it&#8217;s way too computationally expensive to do that atm. In other words, be warned: your fan will spin up.

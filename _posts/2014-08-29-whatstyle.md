i got a lot of use out of the chrome extension WhatFont (wrote about it a couple of weeks ago) and I wanted the option of seeing other CSS properties on the fly so I made my own chrome extension.

it&#8217;s in the chrome webstore [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coidiadldgffddljfiafnabogkhadecg/) and github [here](https://github.com/danyalette/get_style).

Pentagrams and pentagons are actually a bit spooky...
<!--more-->

## Complementary

Penta<i>gons</i> and penta<i>grams</i> are complements:   
They have the same vertex set but exactly opposite edge sets. That is, every pair of vertices that are connected in one graph are _not_ connected in the other.

## Isomorphic

However, pentagons and pentagrams are also isomorphic.

In other words, they are technically _the same graph_ (bearing in mind that a graph is an abstract object and not to be confused with a representation of a graph).

To illustrate: if you labelled the vertices of the pentagon {A, B, C, D, E} clockwise, then the edge set of the pentagon would be {AB, BC, CD, DE, EA}. It is possible to affix those _same_ labels to the pentagram such that the edge set is also {AB, BC, CD, DE, EA}. Reading them off clockwise, the pentagram&#8217;s labels might be, for instance, {A, D, B, E, C}.

So, in a sense, this means that they are

## Equal&Opposite.

Hmm.

But, really, since &#8220;they&#8221; are the same graph, there is no &#8220;they&#8221;. It is technically a single graph that falls in the class of &#8220;self-complementary&#8221; graphs. So, there aren't even two graphs to be equal and opposite to each other.

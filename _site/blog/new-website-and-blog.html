      <p>I finally got around to updating my personal website and blog!</p>

<!--more-->
<p>My personal website was a quirky custom oddity with ancient demos; it wasn’t responsive, or particularly modern in terms of either aesthetics or code. The blog was a wordpress site that I’ve been making tiny iterative tweaks to for years. It was starting to feel pretty fragile. So, I decided to fix them both in one shot, using Jekyll.</p>

<p>The main reason I chose Jekyll is because it’s a static site generator - there’s something delightfully simple about just ending up with a bunch of html files at the end of the day. As for why Jekyll and not some other static site generator: it’s stable, actively maintained, has been adopted for big and successful projects (e.g. Github Pages), and has a decent sized community. (That’s probably a pretty good checklist to look at when adopting any new technology for a project that needs to be productionable.) An extremely awesome side-effect of this choice is that it’s a file-based system so all of the blog data can be seamless tracked using git.</p>

<p>I decided to compile some of the gotchas I encountered while getting Jekyll set up. You can check those out here: <a href="/blog/getting-started-with-jekyll">Getting Started With Jekyll</a>. I also made a little list of tips for people who, like me, are migrating a wordpress site to Jekyll: <a href="/blog/migrating-from-wordpress-to-jekyll">Migrating From Wordpress To Jekyll</a>.</p>

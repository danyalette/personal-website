I've decided to read some classic papers in programming languages over the winter holidays. I'm mostly drawing my list of papers from [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/) and [here](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/courses/670Fall04/GreatWorksInPL.shtml). I'll make a little post with a summary of each one as I go along, and write out anything that I found particularly interesting or surprising.
